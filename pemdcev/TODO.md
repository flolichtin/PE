# TODO

-[x] Table with choice prob and percentage change for each strategy => see `output/decile_table.docx`
-[x] Order in plots (investment and behavioral strategies)
-[x] Marginal effects (facet by strategy and y-axis by variable)
-[x] Use `theme_bw()` and `RColorBrewer` Set2
-[x] Consistent labelling (as in fig. 3 => see `strategy_x_walk()`)
-[x] Add description of postestimation (to plots or in appendix)
-[x] Marginal effects choice probs (`marginal-effects-cp.R` and `marginal-effects-cp-strategy.R`)
-[x] Revise income deciles => use income classes
-[x] Check how you've computed sd (in income effects)
-[x] Universal availabilities in predictions => where does `avail` in `apollo_probabilities()` come from?
-[x] income-effects for different availabilities: avail as observed vs. universal avail (see `data-raw/income-effects-avail.R`)
-[ ] add descriptive average to income_availability_effects plot (see dev.R)
